#### I believed that is not a great solution for this problem because of if statement in length. However, it is still reliable one.

    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        num1_string = str(x) ### For converting integer to string since I want to compare each digit of integer.
        length = len(num1_string)
        if length == 1: #### This statement checks that integer has one digit, if it does, returns 1 immidaetly.
            return True
        for i in range(length//2):
            if num1_string[i] != num1_string[length-i-1]: #### Checking that number is symmetric, if it is not return 0 directly.
                return False
                break
            elif i == length//2-1: #### Verify that we checked all digits in first half has symmetric and we reached middle point without break. Therefore, return 1.
